# Higlight and Delete Dupillcate Rows in a Google Spreadsheet

This is a source code for tutorial on How to Higlight and Delete Dupillcate Rows in a Google Spreadsheet with Google Apps Script.

I've also written two separate blogs, one to highlight and another to delete duplicate rows, which can be read from the links: [https://kcl.hashnode.dev/how-to-highlight-duplicate-rows-in-google-sheets](https://kcl.hashnode.dev/how-to-highlight-duplicate-rows-in-google-sheets) and [https://kcl.hashnode.dev/removing-duplicates-in-google-sheets-a-guide-for-non-coders](https://kcl.hashnode.dev/removing-duplicates-in-google-sheets-a-guide-for-non-coders) respectively..

There's also a youtube tutorial.

## For Non-coders
 Just copy-paste these source code into your apps script project, you can find instructions on how to in the blog, then reload the spreadsheet after saving the script. You'll be able to see the menu which then you can run in that sheet.
